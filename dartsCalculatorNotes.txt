optional ideas to add later:
- edit or undo button for both incorrect scores and submitted scores
- some kind of warning or session so if the page is reset then data doesnt disappear without warning
- disable start game button after game has started
- postgame stats and averages
- where the user clicks on the dartbaord, add dart images. when the user right-clicks the image, it'll remove it.
